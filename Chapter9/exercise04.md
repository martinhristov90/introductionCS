### In this exercise, you’ll create a nested list and then write code that performs operations on that list.

- Create a nested list where each element of the outer list contains the atomic number and atomic weight for an alkaline earth metal. The values are beryllium (4 and 9.012), magnesium (12 and 24.305), calcium (20 and 40.078), strontium (38 and 87.62), barium (56 and 137.327), and radium (88 and 226). Assign the list to variable alkaline_earth_metals.

```python

alkaline_earth_metals = [[4,9.012], [12,24.305], [20,40.078], [38, 87.62], [56,137.327], [88,226]]

```

- Write a for loop to print all the values in alkaline_earth_metals, with the atomic number and atomic weight for each alkaline earth metal on a different line.

```python

>>> for i in alkaline_earth_metals:
    for j in i:
        print(j)

        
4
9.012
12
24.305
20
40.078
38
87.62
56
137.327
88
226
>>> 

```

- Write a for loop to create a new list called number_and_weight that contains the elements of alkaline_earth_metals in the same order but not nested.

```python

alkaline_earth_metals = [[4,9.012], [12,24.305], [20,40.078], [38, 87.62], [56,137.327], [88,226]]

number_and_weight = []

for i in alkaline_earth_metals:
    for j in i:
        number_and_weight.append(j)

print(number_and_weight)

```
